Gardening is more than a hobby-it’s a great form of moderate exercise. Activities like digging, planting, and weeding engage multiple muscle groups, improve flexibility, and burn calories (up to 300 in 30–45 minutes).

## Benefits of Gardening as Exercise
- **Full-body workout:** Strengthens arms, legs, back, and core  
- **Calorie burning:** Comparable to brisk walking or cycling  
- **Improves balance and endurance**  
- **Lowers stress and boosts mood**

## Tips for Better Workout
- Use manual tools  
- Stretch before and after  
- Vary tasks to work different muscles

Gardening helps you stay active, healthy, and happy-all while enjoying nature!
